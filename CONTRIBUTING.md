# Contributions to Gravity PDF

You are more than welcome to create a pull request and contribute to Gravity PDF, but before you do we recommend you [open a new issue on GitHub / check if there is an existing ticket](https://github.com/GravityPDF/gravity-pdf-core-booster/issues) and discuss your use-case beforehand.

## Guidelines

There are a few guidelines that need to be followed to ensure a smooth pull request. These include:

1. Adhere to the existing code standard which mostly follows [WordPress standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/).

1. All PRs must be to the `development` branch.

1. Modifications of the existing codebase must pass all unit tests.

1. Any additions to the plugin must have appropriate unit tests written.

1. PRs that don't pass existing unit testing or do not have the proper tests to accompany the changes will not be merged.

1. Once our team is happy with the PR we'll ask you to squash your branch into a single commit, rebase it onto the development branch and push the changes to GitHub. This ensures we keep a clean Git history.

We've put together these guidelines to streamline the contributor process for our team AND ensure code quality.

If you are uncertain whether your PR meets all these requirements: don't worry! If there are problems our friendly team will guide you in the right direction.

Happy Coding.

-- The Gravity PDF Team.
